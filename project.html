               One of the student of our , The work which I have performed in this website arranged all the member in a systematic and organized way which makes website to look more effective and the implementation which is done the website of grid system . Each member is a cell and there Github profile is directly visible to the screen as well as the cell padding is also use by me to look more organized and not be like has mess! . The member will get added it with automatic it in rows and columns . I have used 7 column automatically it will arranged itself as the member increase . That's the worked performed by me in this website of our college coding club.
